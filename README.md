# Workshop Description

16S_pipeline is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies.

To take this workshop, participants are expected to have basic knowledge as follows: basic knowledge of linux syntax, and basic knowledge of cluster computation.

## Pre-requisites
* Basic knowledge of linux
* Basic knowledge of DCC
* A computer with internet connection

## Workshop Participation

* An overview of 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis.
* Hands-on workshop learning how to run the pipeline on cluster.
